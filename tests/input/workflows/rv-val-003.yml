project-dir: rv-val-003
config: rv-val.toml

# This workflow tried to test renv migration "the real way" but ran into multiple issues.
# Kept for reference on why the simple approach (rv-val-002) is better.
#
# What went wrong:
# 1. renv prompts for consent even with consent options set âœ… Fixed with prompt=FALSE
# 2. Framework timeout bug: treats timeouts as failures even when operations finish fast!
#    (renv completes in 24ms, framework waits 5s, then fails the test anyway)
# 3. File visibility: rv can't find renv-generated files but finds manually created ones
#    (both use same thread structure, so not thread isolation - something about renv vs manual)
#
# Why rv-val-002 works instead:
# - Creates renv.lock manually with writeLines() - rv finds it fine
# - Same thread structure as this workflow, just different file creation method
